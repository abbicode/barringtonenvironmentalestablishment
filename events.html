    <h2>Review</h2>
    <p>5 stars <br><br>This is a unique book that encorporates greek mythology which makes the plot very interesting. The plot, characters, and writing are all well developed. I read this a while ago, but its so unforgetable I had to include a book review about it. Everything about it transports you to another world, which is why its so popular. Excited for the disney adaptation of this book!
