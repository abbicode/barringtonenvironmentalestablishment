      <h2>Eastern Redbud</h2>
      <p>In April and May, many neighborhoods are brightened by the purplish-pink flowers lining the dark branches of redbuds before their leaves open. This Chicago-area native plant evolved in the understory and along the edges of forests. It works especially well among evergreens that contrast with its color and shelter it from intense sunlight. This species is native to the Chicago region according to Swink and Wilhelmâ€™s Plants of the Chicago Region, with updates made according to current research. </p>

       <h2>Red Maple</h2>
      <p>Red maple is a widely adaptable, large tree common to the woods of eastern North America. A red tinge can be found in its flowers, twigs, and seeds, but it is most notable for the scarlet of its leaves in fall. Red maple needs plenty of room for its dense, spreading root system. Fall color can be yellow rather than red, so select a cultivar bred for red fall color. </p>

       <h2>Yellow Poplar</h2>
      <p>One of the tallest and most beautiful eastern hardwoods, with a long, straight trunk, a narrow crown that spreads with age, and large showy flowers resembling tulips or lilies. A tall, straight, deciduous tree, up to150 ft. tall (sometimes taller), tuliptree has a medium to narrow crown and distinctive, star-shaped foliage. The leaves are waxy and smooth, and dependably turn bright gold in fall. Showy, yellow-orange, tulip-like flowers are often missed because they are up 50 ft. or higher in the tops of trees. Cone-shaped seedheads remain after leaves have fallen.</p>
